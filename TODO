Things that need to be fixed and are easy to forget

- Strings in the grammar are far too strict, they currently handle ASCII and a few other characters, these need to handle a much more permissive set of characters

- There's no way to inject the group id of the toggle name if no group id is set, need to see if this actually needs to be injected or if the Server will automatically pass it. This may or may not be an issue but it needs to be determined

- The rules generated by the rule parser currently can't be passed between threads. This needs to be a thing in order to have the FFI layers access

- List rules have mismatched behaviors when they cannot resolve their context values

- The parser is too vague when it fails to parse a rule correctly, this should bubble useful errors
