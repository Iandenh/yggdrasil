# Java SDK Engine

This is the FFI glue code for the Java SDK Engine

## Development

This project relies on an FFI library being in scope, this should be generated by a `cargo build` in the root of Yggdrasil. The header files will also need to be generated, this can be done by running `mvn compile` in the root of this project. Note that these files won't be recompiled, you'll need to run a `mvn clean` and another `mvn compile` if you make any modifications to the native declarations in the Java glue code.
